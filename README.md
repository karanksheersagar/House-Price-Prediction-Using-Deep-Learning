The implementation of TensorFlow Data Validation played a crucial role in optimizing TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch regression models, which included Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Linear Regression, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). 
Through rigorous experimentation, I fine-tuned various aspects such as neuron configurations, learning rates, optimizers, and loss functions. 
This iterative process led to the development of a highly effective Regression Deep Learning model tailored specifically for house price prediction using the California dataset.

With meticulous attention to detail, I explored different settings and configurations to enhance model performance. 
The resulting model boasted detailed parameters and achieved an impressive Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 28k, showcasing its accuracy in predicting house prices. 
Furthermore, I employed effective dataset splitting techniques to ensure the robustness of model training, allowing for reliable predictions.

To address potential overfitting issues, I conducted a thorough analysis of loss trends using TensorBoard. 
This provided valuable insights into the model's performance and helped in making informed decisions to mitigate overfitting concerns. 
Overall, the combination of TensorFlow Data Validation, strategic experimentation, and careful analysis contributed to the development of a top-performing regression model for house price prediction on the California dataset.
